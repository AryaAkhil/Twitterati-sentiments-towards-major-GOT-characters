## Summary

### Keywords: Twitter data, Game of thrones'S8, Text Mining/NLP, Sentiment Analysis.

### Packages: pandas, textblob, nltk, vader

### Overview:
This project aims to showcase how to clean textual (twitter) and perform sentiment analysis. Data used is obtained through Kaggle - GOT'S8. By going through this notebook, one can expect to learn extensive data wrangling on textual data such as stop words removal, POS-tagged lemmatization, regex filtering of text etc and perform sentiment analysis using existing APIs such as vader and textblob. The Jupter Notebook uploaded contains comprehensive data wrangling and sentiment analysis. Follow the inline comments to run through the code.

### Data Source: 
Game of Thrones Season 8 Tweets (https://www.kaggle.com/monogenea/game-of-thrones-twitter).
This dataset contains a collection of tweets captured from 17th April to 28th May 2019, during the airing of Game of Thrones, Season 8.

### Future Work:
The sentiment analysis obtained through the project can be utilized in conjunction with topic modelling of topics/stories that led to such sentiments and
several alternate endings can be hypothesized such that the sentiments may vary towards one's favourite character. *But this is really a far-fetched idea, don't bother*.

### Credits:
A slightly different version of this project was done by me during my master's in business analytics degree at Singapore Management University batch of 2020.
